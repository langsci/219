\BackBody{Three main observations motivate this study: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the combination of the existing documentation and a relatively large and active speaker community offer a unique opportunity to document information structure in ZAI and to study the language as it is used by speakers in everyday life; 

\item as a tonal and verb-initial language, the study of ZAI represents a chance to explore the possible combinations of tone, intonation, morphology and verb-initial syntax that may occur in the coding of information structure, and 

\item the analysis of an endangered language contributes to our theoretical understanding of information structure and informs our knowledge of language documentation practices and revitalization efforts. 

\end{itemize}

Overall, the analysis demonstrates the value and need for information structure studies to document and analyze spontaneous and naturally-occurring discourse, particularly in understudied and endangered languages.}
